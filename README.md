# Introduction
As a newly hired data analyst at a prominent IT and business consulting firm, my primary responsibility is to support the organization's efforts in identifying future skill requirements through data analysis. I will collect data from diverse sources, such as job postings, training portals, and surveys, to identify emerging programming skills.

After gathering sufficient data, I will analyze it to uncover trends and insights, including the top programming languages, database skills, and popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) in demand. The data collection process will involve web scraping and accessing APIs to obtain data in various formats, like.csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.

Once the data is collected, I will utilize data wrangling techniques to clean and prepare it for analysis. Subsequently, I will apply statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data. To present the findings effectively, I will leverage IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard that consolidates all relevant information.

Finally, I will demonstrate my storytelling skills by presenting the findings in a compelling presentation, highlighting key trends and insights derived from the data analysis process. Throughout the project, I will be evaluated based on quizzes in each module and the final project presentation, showcasing proficiency in data collection, analysis, visualization, and communication.

# Module 1: Data Collection
Data Collection is the first step in solving any analysis problem and can be collected in many formats and from many sources. In the first module of the Capstone, we will collect data by scraping the internet and using web APIs.

* [Collecting Data Using APIs](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API.ipynb)
* [Collecting Data Using Web Scraping](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Collecting_Data_Using_Web_Scraping.ipynb)
* [Explore the Data Set](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exploring%20the%20Data%20Set.ipynb)

# Module 2: Data Wrangling
In this module, you will be focusing on the cleaning of your dataset with various techniques. With these techniques you will be identifying duplicate rows, finding missing values, and normalizing the data.

Data Wrangling or Munging is a process in which we clean up the data set and make it ready for data analysis. In this assignment you will perform the following tasks:

* [Identify duplicate rows in the data frame](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

* [Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

* [Find the number of missing values for all columns](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

* [Find the value counts for the column "Employment"](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

* [Normalize the data using two existing columns](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

# Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this module, begin working with the cleaned dataset from the previous module. You will now begin to analyze the dataset to find the distribution of data, presence of outliers and the correlation between different columns.

After cleaning the dataset, your next step is the analysis. In this stage you will become more familiar with the data set and it will start to take shape. In this assignment you will:
* [Plot a distribution curve, and histogram](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

* [Find the median, and outliers of particular columns](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

* [Compute the Inter Quartile Range](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

* [Find out the upper and lower bounds, and find correlations between numerical columns](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

* [Create a new dataframe](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

# Module 4: Data Visualization
In module 4 of the Capstone, you will be required to create visualizations using the developer survey data. The visualizations you create should highlight the distribution of data, relationships between data, the composition of data, and comparison of data.

In this assignment you will now show off your visualization skills by working with the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset. In this assignment you will:

* [Create a histogram to show the distribution of data](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

* [Create different plots such as a scatter, bubble or boxplot](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

* [Create a pie chart, bar chart, and stacked chart to show medians and counts](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

# Module 5:  Dashboard Creation
In this module, you will create a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics. This platform will give you the ability to create various charts while assembling a dashboard that is appealing and easy to understand. Your dashboard will contain your data analysis, which should be intuitive and allow for the drill-down of data.

In this assignment you will continue working with the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data to create a dashboard. In this dashboard you will create the following:

1. <b>Current Technology Usage</b>
* [Bar chart showing Top 10 Languages Worked With](https://github.com/Bipin-11/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Dashboard.pdf)

# Conclusion
This project explored trends in current and future technology (programming languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks) amongst developers. It also explored the demographics (gender, age, and location) of developers.

The analysis showed JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, MySQL, Linux, and Angular/Angular.js emerge as primary technologies in programming, databases, and platforms. Gender gaps persist, with a concentration of talent in the United States, highlighting the need for diversity initiatives. Organizations should align with industry trends and prioritize diversity to drive innovation. Future efforts should focus on fostering inclusivity and addressing disparities to sustain industry growth and innovation.
